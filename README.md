# Student-Data

Goal: To familiarize ourselves with the concept of abstract data type, classes and ojects in java.

Input: 
* Ask the user what they would like to do: 1) load the student file, 2) print the stack or 3) exit the program

Output:
* if user inputs 1, print students loaded from the file (read the text file); 
* if user inputs 2, display the data of students
* if user inputs 3, exit from the loop

Requirements:

* A stack class that defines how to push or pop the data on the stack
* A student class that gets student name, id, gpa, address from the text file 
* An Address class that further splits element in to the components and reads them and also check which component is blank and handle the blank spaces.
* A driver class which collects all the information creates a student object and push them in to stack and pop them when asked.
